## Finding the Correct Region for an S3 Bucket

Sournce: https://twitter.com/hakluke/status/1350553428242493440

```
If you find a S3 subdomain takeover, you need to set up the S3 bucket in the correct region, otherwise it doesn't work.

To find the region, use `dig` to get the IP address, then put the IP into https://isitonaws.com to grab the region easily.
